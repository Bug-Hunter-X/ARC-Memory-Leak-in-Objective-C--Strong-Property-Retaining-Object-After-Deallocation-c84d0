In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with memory management using ARC (Automatic Reference Counting).  Consider the scenario where you have a class 'MyClass' with a property 'myObject' that's a strong reference. If you create an instance of 'MyClass' and set 'myObject' to a new object, and later that 'MyClass' instance goes out of scope, ARC will deallocate the 'MyClass' object but not the object assigned to 'myObject' if you forgot to release it manually.

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (strong, nonatomic) MyOtherClass *myObject;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)someMethod {
    self.myObject = [[MyOtherClass alloc] init];
    // ... some code ...
}
@end
```

This might lead to memory leaks.  The crucial issue is that without a proper release or 'weak' reference, 'myObject' remains allocated even after 'MyClass' is deallocated, causing a memory leak. This is often difficult to trace.
